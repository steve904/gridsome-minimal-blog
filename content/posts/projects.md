## Paint Baseboard Moulding

Today is a great day for painting the baseboard moulding. I have the moulding removed and ready to paint outside on a couple of saw-horses.

## Update #1

Set up saw-horses and have been scraping old paint edges off with 1" wide wood chisel using mostly the side of the chisel to keep from gouging the wood. There was a ridge of old paint where the old carpet line was. I need to sand all of the pieces now.  

## Lunch Time

Took a lunch break and went to McDonald's on Pisgah Church Rd. Went to Country Park with Debbi and the kids and we enjoyed eating our lunch by the lake. Very peaceful and nice. 

## Update #2

All moulding pieces are sanded and ready to paint. Time to put on some old paint clothes and go for it. I will use a 3" roller and brush to paint the wood.


## Organize Items

Things always need attention for organization. If you have time, organize what you can.
