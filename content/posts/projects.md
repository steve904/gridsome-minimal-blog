## Paint Baseboard Moulding

Today is a great day for painting the baseboard moulding. I have the moulding removed and ready to paint outside on a couple of saw-horses.

## Update #1

Set up saw-horses and have been scraping old paint edges off with 1" wide wood chisel using mostly the side of the chisel to keep from gouging the wood. There was a ridge of old paint where the old carpet line was. I need to sand all of the pieces now.  

## Organize Items

Things always need attention for organization. If you have time, organize what you can.
